## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
 + Without outside voices I my implicit bias will assume the user I build for is like me. When that is overwhelmingly not the case. For the sake of expediency I'll    put people in boxes based on my own experiences. So this is something I need to actively think about whenever I'm building something.
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
  + I try to make sure the voices I engage with on social media are either from a background different from mine or are also thinking about their own biases.
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
  + I'd like to work on building things that are great equalizers. Somthing that makes the world more fair and equitable. By understanding my biases I can understand my own blind spots and shortcomings.

#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 + I'm always aware of being a woman in spaces. How is some spaces as a woman I'm more at risk but as a white woman I'm a threat. Also being a feminist and a       leftist.
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 + My identity comes with a lot of privilege, but also makes me hyper aware of microaggressions. I hope to utilize those traits by advocating for others with empathy.
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 +I believe in listening before speaking. I plan to be open enough to hearing others thoughts and where there coming from and not being combative when it's different from my experience.
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 
+ I won't be the first or loudest voice in the room but I will be processing everything around me. I hope to bring empathy and advocacy
